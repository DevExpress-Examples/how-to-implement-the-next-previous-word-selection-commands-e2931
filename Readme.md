# How to implement the next/previous word selection commands


<p>This example demonstrates how to select the next/previous word in the RichEditControl programmatically. The approach from the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E2857">How to change the shortcut key assigned to a command</a> example is used to substitute IKeyboardHandlerService in order to execute the next/previous word commands via shortcuts (F6/F7 in this example). The actual command implementation is based of the following built-in commands:</p><p>NextWordCommand<br />
PreviousWordCommand<br />
ExtendNextWordCommand</p>
